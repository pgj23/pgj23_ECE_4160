#Lab 1: Artiemis Board and Bluetooth
* [Main](index.md)

This lab was divided into 2 parts over to course of two weeks to help us familiarize ourselves with the use of the Arduino IDE and Artemis board before learning how to work with the Artemis board over a bluetooth connection with a computer. 

##Lab 1A

#Prelab

The Prelab for the first part of the lab was simply to download and install the most recent version of the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), and then to install the apollo3 libary from sparkfun by adding it to the libary manager using the json link found [here].
