# Lab 1: Artemis Board and Bluetooth

This lab was divided into 2 parts over to course of two weeks to help us familiarize ourselves with the use of the Arduino IDE and Artemis board before learning how to work with the Artemis board over a bluetooth connection with a computer. 

## Lab 1A

# Prelab

The Prelab for the first part of the lab was simply to download and install the most recent version of the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), and then to install the apollo3 libary from sparkfun by adding it to the libary manager using the json link found [here].

# Lab

The bulk of Lab 1A was testing our ability to use the Arduino IDE to flash code to our Artemis board and run it. There were 4 example programs that were run to verify the functionality of  specific parts of the board.

### 1. Blinky

As is always the case when testing a new microcontroller board, the first test run was to blink a single LED. The "Blinky" example code was taken from the built-in-examples section of the Arduino IDE
